# Types of GIT code Repository

A code repository is an archive of the code that is being worked on. Beyond the code itself, you can keep things such as documentation, notes, web pages, and other items in your repository. A code repository is required for any successful software development project.

Few important Git code repositories hosting services are

- GitHub
- GitLab
- Bitbucket

## GitHub
GitHub is one of the most popular code repositories out there. GitHub offers a list of popular features:

- Commit history is visible
- Pull requests
- Issue tracking
- Email notifications
- Robust and well-documented API
- Unlimited private repositories
- A wide array of workflow automations and CI/CD through GitHub Actions

## GitLab 
GitLab is also a very common repository. GitLab has a slightly more user-friendly interface than GitHub. GitLab offers robust CI/CD pipelines and workflow automation, which was previously their biggest competitive advantage over GitHub. It is used for highly technical teams who aren't planning on collaborating outside of their organization as much. 

## Bitbucket
Like GitLab and GitHub, Bitbucket also offers a free tier for private repositories. Like GitHub, Bitbucket offers many similar features: Commit history, Pull requests, Issue tracking.
